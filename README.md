# Bar Kadosh's Pre-Lab 2

Pre-Lab Ideas

1.	Circuit Workout: A device that takes in two time parameters â€“ length of each set of the circuit and rest time between circuits. The device will then light up or make appropriate sounds to notify the user if they should start working out or stop and take a rest.
2.	Metronome: A device that takes in two time-related parameters: tempo (can be converted to time in between beats) and what type of time (3/4, 4/4, etc.). The device will then beat appropriately with the tempo and will add a special noise to the first beat of the time style (so as to make clear if it is 3/4, 4/4, etc.).
3.	Work Day: A personalized device for each employee. When arriving at work, you push the button and the timer will start. When you leave, you push it again and the timer will stop. This will allow for proper reporting of time worked. 
4.	Marathon Runner: A device that takes in a number of miles and a specified value of time that the runner wants to be able to run the distance in. When the runner starts running, he or she pushes a button. The device will light up or make a sound every time the runner should have completed a quarter mile lap if he or she wants to stay on pace.
5.	Keep-Me-Awake: A device intended to keep you awake. A button is pushed and if it is not pushed every 30 minutes, it will make loud noises to wake you up. By pushing every 30 minutes, you are communicating to the device that you are still awake and do not need to be woken up.
6.	Heart Rate Monitor: Click a button. Start counting how many times your heart beats/your pulse. After 60 seconds, an alarm will sound or a light will flash and you will have measured your heart rate.
7.	Get Up and Stretch: When using a computer for a prolonged period of time, use this device. After initially hitting a button, the device will notify you through light or sound every hour so that you get up and stretch and look away from the screen.
8.	Eating Contest: With this device, an alarm will sound after a specified time. Within that time, each contestant clicks one of the buttons after each hot dog they eat (to keep score). This will determine who can eat the most hot dogs in a certain timeframe.
9.	Mental Clock: This device allows for a game. After initially hitting a button, you mentally try to count to 30 and hit the button to try to make the timer stop right at 30 seconds. The device will output how much time actually elapsed between the two presses and whoever gets closest wins the game. 
10.	 Dance Party: When prompted, a countdown will start. Once it hits zero, music will play and lights/visuals will accompany it, so that people present can dance. Once the song is over, it will prompt the dancers to see if they want to keep dancing. If they indicate they want to, the countdown will restart and the dancers can dance again to the music.
